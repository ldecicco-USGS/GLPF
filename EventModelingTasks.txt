1. Use event groupings (eventFreqAndDates.csv) to attempt individual models.
  -use only groups with >= 20 observations.
  
2. Compile selected variables from models by event.

3. Show Fl variables on EEMS graph for each event--separate EEMs per event
   -Choose an EEMs graph to use as an example of where things are
   -use files here: .\raw_data\opticalSummary to locate where signals are
     -Draw line between signals for ratios
	 
4. If possible, include multiple EEMs graphs per page to examine locations of signals

5. Reduce signals based on similarity

6. Build model for whole data set based on final signals chosen

7. Plot by event to evaluate effectiveness
